For this problem we essentially had to find out if there
are any cycles and if there are return false, if not return
true, decided that I could use topological sorting and if it's 
able to visit every vertice, then we know its true since 
topological sorting wont visit every node if theres a cycle. I used a 
BFS algorithm to traverse the graph
