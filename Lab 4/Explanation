My plan for this lab was essentially to start all the way from the bottom 
of one side and work my way up from there, first recursively we went all 
the way down to the bottom of the tree, once we find the left bottom most node
we go up and swap the left and right children on the left side then we do the same 
thing on the right side before lastly swapping the left and right children of
the root then returning the root value
